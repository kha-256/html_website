  <h1 >Li River, China</h1>
  <div id=paragraph>
    <p>
      Arising from the Mao’er Mountain in Xing’an County, Lijiang River passes through Guilin, Yangshuo, Pingle and Zhaoping to open out into the Xijiang River in Wuzhou. It has a total length of 437 kilometers and is flanked by unique scenery of green karst hills which attract thousands of visitors each year. The section of the Li River that winds its way down from Guilin to Yangshuo is perhaps one of the most famous waterways in China. This fame originates from the gorgeous scenery on both riverbanks that has long been recognized as both calming and inspiring    </p>

      <p>
        The water stretches 83 kilometers from Guilin to Yangshuo. Meandering among piles after pile of hills with grotesque peaks flanking the emerald and limpid water, it is embellished by vivid reflections of scenery along the river and fertile lands covered in brocade or veiled in mists. No matter if the sun is shining or it is raining both leads to beautiful scenery. Li River winds through rapids and shallows, past valleys, waterfalls, bamboo groves and green rocks. The verdant mountains are covered with lush bamboo and luxuriant forests. Guilin’s mountains and hills are never too tall. Reflections of these elegant conical limestone peaks on mirror-like clear water of the Li River are just like a fairyland on earth.
