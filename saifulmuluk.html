  <h1 >Saiful Muluk, Pakistan</h1>
  <div id=paragraph>
    <p>
      Saiful Muluk is a mountainous lake located at the northern end of the Kaghan Valley, near the town of Naran in the Saiful Muluk National Park. At an elevation of 3,224 m (10,578 feet) above sea level, the lake is located above the tree line, and is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan. </p>

      <p>
        The lake is kind of a bowl where multiple glacial waters accumulate. However, it consists of large eco-diversity which includes a rare brown trout fish, bulk amount of blue-green algae, and a variety of water-plants and phytoplankton. Trout fishing is quite popular in Kaghan and in Naran as well.The magical lake is completely frozen during winters due to heavy snowfall. The ideal time for tourists starts from June to September. The weather of this divine place is extremely pleasant during day time(about 15-20 degree centigrade), whereas at night the temperature drops to three degrees centigrade.
        Boating facility is also available for adventure enthusiasts. The experience may be full of excitement but one should be careful because the lake’s depth is still unknown, and there aren’t rescue equipments. So do boating at your own risk! Ponies and horses are also available if one doesn’t want to travel on foot.Camping at the time of the full moon is like sitting in a fairyland. It is highly recommended for those who want to see the moon shining at it brightest amongst five billion stars in the sky.
