  <h1>Know Me better!</h1>
  <div id="know">
    <p>I am a traveller. I am a curious girl who loves to wander around to create memories and learn new things. More than destinations; I love meeting people and indulge in heartfelt conversations. I find joy in all the small things in life. Sometimes an exchange of smile with a stranger can uplift my mood. Emotions run high in my life. So, I do tend to get very emotional (a bit too much) about the places I like and people I love. A hopeless romantic by nature, this curious girl doesn’t endorse any rude behaviour from anyone. And, hey…I prefer the countryside anytime over cities, anywhere in the world. </p>

    <p>I grew up in a Karachi. During my childhood, I remember being glued to our TV set whenever there were travel-related programs being aired. If there was anything at all which fascinated me the most, it was TRAVEL for me. I often imagined myself as a traveller, exploring every destination shown on my Black & White television set (We still have that vintage television somewhere in our storage). Believe or not, unlike other kids of my age, I never used to read any children books or watch cartoon shows (I still don’t know the names of the famous cartoon characters, because, I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED).</p>
  
    <P>As I grew up, my curiosity to discover the world only grew with each passing moment. Finally, in 2015, I took my first trip to Saiful Muluk in Naran after just seeing a photograph of a lake. A whole new world of discoveries started from there. After that, I never looked back. I knew what my true calling was.</P>
